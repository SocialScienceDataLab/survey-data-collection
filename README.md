# Survey data collection from start to finish: Designing and executing reproducible research with an online access panel

📍 virtual MZES, Mannheim

📆 March 02, 2022

Fielding an online survey with an access panel or crowdsourcing platform can be a quick, flexible, and relatively low-cost method of collecting data from the general population. However, social scientists who want to conduct their own survey for the first time may not know where to begin in planning their data collection. In this talk, we will walk through the process of planning and conducting a survey with an online access panel step by step. We will use our own recent data collection as an example, a survey experiment in Germany conducted as part of a replication seminar at the University of Mannheim in 2021. In addition to topics like ethical approval, sampling, and choosing a survey provider, we will also discuss how researchers can work reproducibly by pre-registering their designs and sharing data and code.
